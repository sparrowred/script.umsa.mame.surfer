    <summary lang="en">Frontend for MAME with the UMSA twist</summary>
    <description lang="en">Easy to use browser and launcher for emulators based on UMSA
UMSA is based on MAME and it's Software Lists and combines all
software ports, conversion, remakes and sometimes even unoffical ones.

** Note ** This piece of software is absolut alpha status.
Many functions are not implemented or only half way
and there are many known and unknown bugs,
It's just a hobby side project for umsa.ini to
showcase it and encourage other frontend authors to support it.

Thanks:
The MAME team and all dat and ini authors, the Kodi team and RCB author malte
and of course progetto-SNAPS for the wonderful collection of artwork.
